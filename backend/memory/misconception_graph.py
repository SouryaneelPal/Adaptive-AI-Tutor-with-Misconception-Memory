"""
misconception_graph.py
----------------------
Manages the prerequisite dependency graph for the curriculum concepts, backed
by Neo4j. Helps the Diagnostic Agent (backend/agents/diagnostic_agent.py) and
Tutor Planner identify missing prerequisite skills using an actual curriculum
structure instead of letting the LLM invent prerequisite names from scratch
each turn.

Data model
==========
    (:Concept {name})-[:REQUIRES]->(:Concept {name})

`SEED_CONCEPT_DEPENDENCIES` below is the initial curriculum graph — call
`seed_concept_graph()` once against a fresh Neo4j instance to load it in.
It is a seed for the graph, not the runtime source of truth: once seeded,
`get_prerequisites`/`get_deep_prerequisites` read from Neo4j, so edits to
the curriculum should happen via Cypher (or by re-running the seed) rather
than by editing this dict after the first seed.

Every function here degrades safely (logs a warning, returns `[]`) if Neo4j
is unreachable, matching the fallback contract used throughout backend/memory
and backend/agents — a missing graph must never crash a tutoring turn.

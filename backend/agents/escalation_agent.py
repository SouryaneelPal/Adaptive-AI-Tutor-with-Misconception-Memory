escalation_agent.py
--------------------
Escalation Agent for the Adaptive AI Tutor with Misconception Memory.

Role
====
This agent replaces the dummy `escalator_node` in orchestrator.py. It runs
when diagnostic_agent.py's `recommended_strategy` is "escalate_to_teacher"
(typically repeated failures on the same concept and/or distress language in
the student's response). It does two distinct jobs in one call:

    1. Teacher-facing: writes a short, insightful "Teacher Alert Summary"
       for the teacher_dashboard.py view — WHAT the student is stuck on,
       WHY (root misconception / pattern), and how urgent it feels.

    2. Student-facing: writes a warm, honest "holding message" telling the
       student their teacher has been looped in, WITHOUT giving away the
       answer and without sounding clinical or alarming.

Unlike hint_generator.py, this agent never needs to reason about the hint
ladder — it always produces both outputs, and `escalation_flag` is always
True by construction (it's only ever invoked once that decision has already
been made upstream by the Diagnostic Agent / orchestrator routing).

This module is designed as a single node inside a LangGraph `StateGraph`,
replacing the placeholder `escalator_node` referenced in orchestrator.py.

Tech stack: Python 3.10+, LangChain, Ollama (local inference via
`langchain_ollama.ChatOllama`), Pydantic v2.

You are the Escalation Agent inside an Adaptive AI Tutor. You are activated \
ONLY when another agent has already decided a human teacher needs to step \
in — usually because the student has repeatedly missed the same concept, or \
their response shows frustration, distress, or disengagement. You do not \
decide whether to escalate; that decision is already final. Your job is to \
write two short pieces of text.

1. `teacher_summary` — written FOR THE TEACHER, not the student. In 2-3 \
   sentences, explain:
   - What concept/question the student is stuck on.
   - The core misconception or gap driving the errors (use \
     diagnostic_result's identified_misconception / missing_prerequisite \
     and the pattern in student_memory_profile, e.g. consecutive misses).
   - The student's apparent frustration or confidence level, if evident from \
     their response (e.g., "expressed frustration and disengagement" vs \
     "calm but stuck after repeated attempts").
   Be concrete and specific — avoid generic phrases like "needs more practice". \
   Write like a colleague briefing another teacher before they step in.

2. `student_message` — written FOR THE STUDENT, shown directly in their chat. \
   It must:
   - Acknowledge their effort without being condescending.
   - Clearly but gently say their teacher is being looped in to help.
   - NEVER reveal or imply the answer to current_question.
   - Never sound clinical, alarming, or like it's describing them as a \
     "problem" — keep it warm and reassuring, 1-3 sentences.
